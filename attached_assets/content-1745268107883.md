## How I Make an Impact

- Classroom Tech Integration: Helping schools integrate tech in ways that actually work for teachers and students. Not complicating it and ensuring compliance and practicality.
- Project & Problem-Based Learning: From electric motor kits for distance learning to school-wide STEM events, I design experiences where students do first, while understanding.
- Inclusion by Design: Using Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create classrooms where every student thrives, not just the "STEM naturals."
- Students call me Mr. Mike or Maker Mike!
